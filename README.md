For this project, I focused on learning about APIs by creating a Pokémon Finder that displays key information about a Pokémon, including its character sprite.

- To achieve this, I used async/await functions and fetch to retrieve data from the API and display it on the website.
- For added polish, I incorporated Bootstrap to improve the front-end design and layout.
- When the correct Pokémon name or ID is entered, the relevant information is displayed. If an incorrect name is entered, an error message appears.
- The Pokémon can be searched either by name or ID number. Additionally, the app accounts for Pokémon with multiple types, handling type arrays appropriately.
- As a bonus feature, I added a checkbox that, when selected, shows the Pokémon in its shiny form.

This project was a great introduction to working with JavaScript and understanding how APIs are used in web development.

PS What is your favourite Pokemon? Mine is Genesect :>
